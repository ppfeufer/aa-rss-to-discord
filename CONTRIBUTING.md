# Contributing to Alliance Auth RSS to Discord

## Code Formatting

This app is utilizing the [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style.html)
code style. Every commit has to adhere to it.

This repository uses [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) to
verify compliance with formatting rules. To use:

1. Install `pre-commit`.
2. From inside the `aa-rss-to-discord` root directory, run `pre-commit install`.
3. You're all done! Code will be checked automatically using git hooks.

You can check if your code to commit adheres to the given style by simply running:
```shell script
pre-commit
```

or to check all files:
```shell script
pre-commit run --all-files
```

The following will be checked by `pre-commit`:

- no trailing whitespaces (excluded are: minified js and css, .po and .mo files)
- one, and only one, empty line at the end of every file (excluded are: minified js
  and css, .po and .mo files)
- line ending is LF
- code formatted according to black code style
- code conforms with flake8
